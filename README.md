## Installation
No installation required - this is hosted live on [Heroku](https://bloggerrrati.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
Once you make an account, you are supposed to be able to create posts, add comments, and view your posts on your dashboard. However, I struggled a lot with this homework. I'll definetly be coming back to this one when I understand this better.
